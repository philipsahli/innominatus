# User Guide

**Welcome, Developer!** ðŸ‘‹

Your Platform Team has set up innominatus for you. This guide will help you deploy your applications using Score specifications.

## What You Need to Know

innominatus is a **platform orchestration service** that your Platform Team manages. You don't need to install or configure it - it's already running and ready for you to use.

**What innominatus does for you:**
- Takes your Score specification (simple YAML file)
- Orchestrates complex multi-step deployments
- Provisions infrastructure (databases, storage, networks)
- Deploys your application to Kubernetes
- Sets up monitoring and logging

**What you need:**
- âœ… Access credentials from your Platform Team
- âœ… The `innominatus-ctl` CLI tool (download from your platform portal)
- âœ… A Score specification for your application

## What's a Score Specification?

Score is a platform-agnostic workload specification format. You describe **what** you need (containers, databases, routes), not **how** to provision them.

**Example Score Spec:**
```yaml
apiVersion: score.dev/v1b1
metadata:
  name: my-app

containers:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest

resources:
  db:
    type: postgres
  route:
    type: route
    params:
      host: my-app.company.com
```
