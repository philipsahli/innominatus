## What is innominatus?

innominatus orchestrates complex deployment workflows from [Score specifications](https://score.dev).

**Core Value:**
- **For Platform Teams:** Centralized workflow orchestration with audit trails
- **For Developers:** Self-service deployment via simple Score specs
- **For Organizations:** Standardized golden paths with compliance built-in

## Architecture

innominatus is designed for **enterprise platform integration**:

    C --> D[Terraform]
    C --> E[Kubernetes]
    C --> F[Ansible]
    B --> G[(PostgreSQL)]
```

## Use Cases

### Platform Integration
Integrate with existing IDPs like Backstage, CNOE, or custom platforms via REST API.

### Golden Path Deployment
Use pre-defined workflows for standardized application deployment patterns.

### Multi-Environment Management
Deploy applications across development, staging, and production with environment-specific configuration.

### GitOps Orchestration
Trigger workflows from Git repositories and integrate with ArgoCD.
