## Gaps Closed in Session 2

### ✅ P0-8: Environment List Not Available in UI

**Problem:** Users could not browse available environments before deploying applications. Environment information was only visible in golden path execution, limiting discoverability.

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Created Environments Page** (`/environments`)
   - Full listing of all available environments
   - Environment type, status, and descriptions
   - Statistics cards (total count, active status)
   - Information card explaining environment concepts

2. **API Integration:**
   - Added `getEnvironments()` method to API client
   - Uses existing `/api/environments` endpoint
   - Integrated with React state management

3. **Navigation Updates:**
   - Added "Environments" link to Platform section
   - Globe icon for visual consistency
   - Positioned logically between Resources and Dependency Graph

**Files Modified:**
- `web-ui/src/app/environments/page.tsx` - New full-featured page (230 lines)
- `web-ui/src/lib/api.ts` - Added getEnvironments() method
- `web-ui/src/components/navigation.tsx` - Added navigation link

**User Experience:**
- Users can now see all available deployment targets before deployment
- Clear descriptions help users understand environment purposes
- Statistics provide quick overview of system state

**Impact:** Eliminates confusion about available deployment targets. Users no longer need to guess or consult external documentation.

---

### ✅ P0-7: User Management API Missing

**Problem:** CLI bypassed API layer for user management, directly manipulating `users.yaml` file. This created inconsistency, security concerns, and prevented proper auditing.

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Created User Management API Endpoints:**
   - `POST /api/admin/users` - Create new user
   - `GET /api/admin/users/{username}` - Get user details
   - `PUT /api/admin/users/{username}` - Update user (password, team, role)
   - `DELETE /api/admin/users/{username}` - Delete user

2. **API Handler Implementation:**
   - Full CRUD operations with proper validation
   - Role validation (user|admin)
   - Duplicate user detection
   - Password field excluded from GET responses
   - Proper HTTP status codes (201 Created, 404 Not Found, etc.)

3. **CLI Migration:**
   - Updated `addUserCommand()` to use `CreateUser()` API
   - Updated `listUsersCommand()` to use `ListUsers()` API
   - Updated `deleteUserCommand()` to use `DeleteUser()` API
   - All commands now go through authenticated API layer

4. **Client Methods Added:**
   ```go
   func (c *Client) CreateUser(username, password, team, role string) error
   func (c *Client) GetUser(username string) (*User, error)
   func (c *Client) ListUsers() ([]User, error)
   func (c *Client) UpdateUser(username string, updates map[string]string) error
   func (c *Client) DeleteUser(username string) error
   ```

**Files Modified:**
- `internal/server/auth_handlers.go` - Added 4 handler functions (~200 lines)
- `internal/cli/client.go` - Added 5 API client methods (~50 lines)
- `internal/cli/commands.go` - Updated 3 command implementations
- `cmd/server/main.go` - Registered new routes

**Security Benefits:**
- All user operations now go through authentication/authorization
- Admin-only middleware enforces access control
- API layer enables audit logging
- Removes direct file access from CLI

**Impact:** Establishes proper architectural layering. Enables future features like audit trails, RBAC enhancements, and multi-backend support.

---

### ✅ P0-6: API Key Management Access Control Inconsistency

**Problem:** Admins could not manage other users' API keys through a consistent interface. API key management was limited to self-service only.

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Created Admin API Key Endpoints:**
   - `GET /api/admin/users/{username}/api-keys` - List user's API keys
   - `POST /api/admin/users/{username}/api-keys` - Generate API key for user
   - `DELETE /api/admin/users/{username}/api-keys/{keyname}` - Revoke user's API key

2. **Handler Implementation:**
   - Supports both file-based users (users.yaml) and OIDC users (database)
   - Automatic detection of user type
   - Proper key masking in responses (show first 8 + last 4 chars)
   - Full key returned only on creation
   - Consistent with existing `/api/profile/api-keys` pattern

3. **CLI Admin Commands:**
   ```bash
   innominatus-ctl admin user-api-keys <username>
   innominatus-ctl admin user-generate-key --username <user> --name <keyname> --expiry-days <days>
   innominatus-ctl admin user-revoke-key --username <user> --key-name <keyname>
   ```

4. **Client Methods Added:**
   ```go
   func (c *Client) AdminGetAPIKeys(username string) ([]map[string]interface{}, error)
   func (c *Client) AdminGenerateAPIKey(username, name string, expiryDays int) (map[string]interface{}, error)
   func (c *Client) AdminRevokeAPIKey(username, keyName string) error
   ```

**Files Modified:**
- `internal/server/auth_handlers.go` - Added 5 handler functions (~230 lines)
- `internal/cli/client.go` - Added 3 API client methods
- `internal/cli/commands.go` - Added 3 command implementations (~105 lines)
- `cmd/server/main.go` - Registered routes with routing logic
- `cmd/cli/main.go` - Updated help text and examples

**Admin Workflows Enabled:**
- Generate API keys for users during onboarding
- Revoke compromised keys immediately
- Audit all API keys across organization
- Manage keys for users who've lost access

**Impact:** Admins now have full control over API key lifecycle for all users. Enables proper key rotation policies and security incident response.

---

### ✅ P0-4: Golden Paths Not Server-Managed

**Problem:** Golden paths were defined locally in code (CLI and UI both had local definitions). This created drift risk as paths evolved and prevented dynamic management.

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Created Golden Paths API Endpoints:**
   - `GET /api/golden-paths` - List all golden paths with metadata
   - `GET /api/golden-paths/{name}` - Get detailed metadata for specific path

2. **API Handler Implementation:**
   - Loads from centralized `goldenpaths.yaml`
   - Returns rich metadata: description, category, tags, estimated duration
   - Includes parameter schemas with validation rules
   - Backward compatible with deprecated fields (required_params, optional_params)
   - Single source of truth for all clients

3. **Response Format:**
   ```json
   {
     "deploy-app": {
       "description": "Deploy application with Score specification",
       "category": "deployment",
       "tags": ["core", "production"],
       "estimated_duration": "5-10 minutes",
       "workflow_file": "workflows/deploy-app.yaml",
       "parameters": {
         "environment": {
           "type": "enum",
           "allowed_values": ["dev", "staging", "prod"],
           "description": "Target environment",
           "required": true
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

**Files Modified:**
- `internal/server/handlers.go` - Added HandleGoldenPaths and 2 helper functions (~110 lines)
- `cmd/server/main.go` - Registered `/api/golden-paths` routes
- Added `goldenpaths` import to handlers.go

**Future Capabilities Enabled:**
- Dynamic golden path UI in Web UI
- CLI can discover paths without code updates
- Parameter validation based on server-side schemas
- Version golden paths independently of client code
- A/B testing of workflow changes

**Impact:** Eliminates drift between CLI and UI. Enables self-service golden path management. Future-proofs architecture for dynamic workflow capabilities.
