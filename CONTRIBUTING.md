---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.21+**
- **PostgreSQL 13+** (for running tests locally)
- **Docker Desktop** with Kubernetes enabled (for demo environment)
- **kubectl** configured with cluster access
- **Git** for version control

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/idp-o.git
cd idp-o
```

3. Add the upstream repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/philipsahli/idp-o.git
```

### Build and Run

```bash
# Build the server
go build -o innominatus cmd/server/main.go

# Build the CLI
go build -o innominatus-ctl cmd/cli/main.go

# Run tests
go test ./... -v

# Run linters
golangci-lint run
gosec ./...
```

### Install Development Tools

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
brew install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Install golangci-lint
brew install golangci-lint

# Install gosec
go install github.com/securego/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest

# Install goimports
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
```

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. **Create a Branch**

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
# Update your fork
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feat/add-helm-workflow-step
```

**Branch Naming Conventions**:
- `feat/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation changes
- `test/description` - Test additions or changes
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `chore/description` - Maintenance tasks

### 2. **Make Your Changes**

Write clean, well-documented code:

```go
// Good: Clear function with documentation
// ProcessWorkflow executes a workflow for the given Score specification.
// It validates the spec, creates a workflow execution record, and processes
// each step sequentially with proper error handling.
func ProcessWorkflow(spec *types.ScoreSpec) error {
    // Implementation...
}
```

### 3. **Write Tests**

All new code should include tests:

```go
func TestProcessWorkflow(t *testing.T) {
    spec := &types.ScoreSpec{
        Metadata: types.Metadata{
            Name: "test-app",
        },
    }

    err := ProcessWorkflow(spec)
    assert.NoError(t, err)
}
```

### 4. **Run Pre-Commit Checks**

Before committing, ensure all checks pass:

```bash
# Pre-commit will automatically run on git commit
# Or run manually:
pre-commit run --all-files
```

This runs:
- Trailing whitespace removal
- EOF fixer
- YAML validation
- go-fmt, go-vet, go-imports
- golangci-lint
- gosec security scanning
- Prettier (for web-ui)

### 5. **Commit Your Changes**

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add Helm workflow step type

- Implement HelmStepExecutor for chart deployments
- Add support for values files and inline values
- Include integration tests with local Helm charts
- Update documentation with Helm step examples

Closes #123"
```

### 6. **Push and Create PR**

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin feat/add-helm-workflow-step

# Create a pull request on GitHub
```

---

## Coding Standards

### Go Code Style

- Follow [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) guidelines
- Use `gofmt` for formatting (enforced by pre-commit)
- Run `golangci-lint` and fix all issues
- Ensure `gosec` security scanner passes
- Write clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions and types
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible

### Error Handling

```go
// Good: Contextual error messages
if err := db.SaveWorkflow(workflow); err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to save workflow %s: %w", workflow.Name, err)
}

// Bad: Generic error messages
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```

### Logging

Use structured logging with appropriate levels:

```go
log.Info("Starting workflow execution",
    "workflow_id", workflow.ID,
    "app_name", workflow.AppName,
)

log.Error("Workflow step failed",
    "workflow_id", workflow.ID,
    "step", step.Name,
    "error", err,
)
```

### Security

- Never hardcode secrets or credentials
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Validate all user input
- Sanitize file paths and commands
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Document security considerations in code comments

---

## Commit Message Guidelines

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to maintain a clean, semantic commit history.

### Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **feat**: New feature for the user
- **fix**: Bug fix for the user
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring (no feature change)
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks (dependencies, CI, etc.)
- **ci**: CI/CD pipeline changes
- **build**: Build system or dependency changes

### Examples

```bash
# Feature with scope
feat(workflow): add Helm chart deployment step

# Bug fix with issue reference
fix(api): prevent race condition in workflow status updates

Fixes #234

# Breaking change
feat(auth)!: replace basic auth with JWT-based authentication

BREAKING CHANGE: Basic authentication is no longer supported.
All API clients must use JWT tokens.

# Documentation
docs: add production deployment guide

# Multiple changes
feat: implement RBAC for workflow execution

- Add role-based permission model
- Implement middleware for permission checks
- Add admin endpoints for role management
- Update API documentation

Closes #156
```

### Commit Message Rules

1. **Use imperative mood**: "add feature" not "added feature"
2. **First line under 72 characters**: Keep the summary concise
3. **Reference issues**: Use "Closes #123" or "Fixes #456"
4. **Explain why**: The body should explain why the change was made
5. **One logical change**: Each commit should represent one logical change
